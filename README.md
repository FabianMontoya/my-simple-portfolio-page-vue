# Simple portfolio vue page by Fabian Montoya

This repo is about a simple page building with Vue.js (3), SASS and TS trying to follow clean practice, clean architecture and clean code.

I used BEM nomeclature for the most of the class names and I used the 1-7 patron for the folder structure of the scss files.

For the folder scheme of the app and the components I tried to use the Single Responsability principle
